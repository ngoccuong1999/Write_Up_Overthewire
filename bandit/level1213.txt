The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

solve: 
xxd -r data.txt > bandit (reverse hexdump and sent to output to a file)

file bandit (gzip compress)
gzip -d bandit 
(bzip compress)
bzip -d bandit
tar -xf bandit(POSIX tar archive)
