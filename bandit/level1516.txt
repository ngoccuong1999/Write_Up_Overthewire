The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.

Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…

solution:

echo BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr |  openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:30001

password; cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd
