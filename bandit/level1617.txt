The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

solution:

Dung nmap quet port thay 5 port mo sau do quet All voi 5 port nay phat hien 2 port xai ssl, trong do 1 port sai ssl echo ping nen dung port con lai 

nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost

nmap -A -T4 -p 1234,1234 localhost
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit16 | openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -quiet > /tmp/key/crossline

ssh -i /tmp/key/crossline bandit17@localhost
